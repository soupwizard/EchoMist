# EchoMist
Test project for SonarCloud

Requirements:
    pytest needs to be installed

To manually run test cases for calculator.py, on the command line:
    $ pytest test_calculator.py

SonarCloud:

- Created new sonarcloud account, using my soupwizard github account as login
- Added EchoMist repository to sonarcloud
- Now adding this text to for a git commit which should cause sonarcloud to do
  some analysis. Wonder if it will run pytest automatically?
